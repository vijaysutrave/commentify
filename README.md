Add documentation comments to your code, with one npm command! 

Everybody likes to read well documented code. 
It's easier for a newbie to understand what's going on. 
Gives your peer an understanding of what you're really trying to do.

This package, adds comments to all functions like a pattern specified in [jsDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/about-getting-started.html#adding-documentation-comments-to-your-code). 

Just add in your custom function description to the comment pattern, and you're awesome!


#### Install
`npm install -g commentify`

#### Usage
Run `commentify` in any directory. 

The prompt will check if you want to comment a file, or all files in a directory. 
If file, do not enter the `.js` extension at the end of file. Also, give in a relative path from the current directory.
